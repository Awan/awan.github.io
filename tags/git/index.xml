      <description>Git cherry-picking Aah picking cherries! ❤️
I&amp;rsquo;m using git since I started using linux. Cherry-pick is one of those commands I do alot with git. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m preparing a new cherry and will pick it later. 😉
What&amp;rsquo;s cherry-pick? According to man(1) git-cherry-pick:
Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</description>

      <description>Git is another awesome tool developed and maintained by Linus Torvalds who wrote linux kernel. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how can we use it for our site maintenance. I have a vps on which my site is hosted along with a mail server, git server and a web server too. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure this guide can be used with shared hosting accounts with some modifications.
Install git. Once installed, as root user, create git user and add it to www-data group.</description>

      <description>So you want to contribute to some open source project which is hosted on git[hub,lab] or some other git website. Here is all you want to do.
Fork the repository Create a personal fork. On github, visit the project repository and hit fork. It will fork the project in your personal account.
Clone it Clone it in your local machine so you can work on it. Remember you are cloning the fork, and not the original project.</description>
