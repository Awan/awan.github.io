      <description>Git is another awesome tool developed and maintained by Linus Torvalds who wrote linux kernel. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how can we use it for our site maintenance. I have a vps on which my site is hosted along with a mail server, git server and a web server too. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure this guide can be used with shared hosting accounts with some modifications.
Install git. Once installed, as root user, create git user and add it to www-data group.</description>

Debian is one of the oldest distribution there which is known for stability. Stability? Well that never had been a priority for me but for some reasons I came to it and now using it for some months. It&amp;rsquo;s a cool distribution.
Well, that enough said, let&amp;rsquo;s come to the topic.</description>
