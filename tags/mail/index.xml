      <description>why commandline? TL;DR
powerful and efficient!
I have been creating multiple accounts for email since 2009. Some of the accounts I still have them in 2019 and others I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to. I realized that having your own email server on your own domain is a good thing. So I started creating mail server. I did that well. Learned a lot.
As you know I like things to keep minimalistic yet powerful than most written GUI apps.</description>
