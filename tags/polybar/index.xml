      <description>Multihead A few days ago, I relocated myself to new room. Actually this room I use for summer as its way cooler than others. I have a wall-mounted LCD monitor here so today I thought I should share how I do multi screening.
Hardware I have this lenovo X series machine which is my main machine I use. Its resolution is 1920x1080. The second one is a LCD monitor. And the resolution is 1280x1024.</description>
